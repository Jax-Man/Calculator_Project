## You should be able to play around with it [here](https://jax-man.github.io/Calculator_Project/)

### this project was done in part for [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodecamp.org)
***
### this project demonstrates my ability to: 

1. utilize javascript logic to make a functional calculator
2. build a pleasing design using css, bootstrap and many other Front end development libraries
3. using react-redux to make components and stores to hold variables
4. compile and build a production version to host on github
